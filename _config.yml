  Hi and welcome to my CV page.

  I am Julia, and I am an English Teacher. I am primarily interested in teaching adults in group settings, and also in
  teacher training.

  I was born in Ukraine, got [my CELTA degree](#certifications) in London, and worked in various educational institutions including [International
  House London](#career). Check out my [certifications](#certifications), hear [my students](#testimonials) have a say, or just [get in touch](#contacts).

  I am interesting in career opportunities, coaching and teacher training. On my way to DELTA specialisation.

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
