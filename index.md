### Hear My Students

When working with a student, I always look into what is their goal: why they want to improve their English level? 
Answer to this question has a great impact on the learning path and techniques. 

I have asked a few of my former students to record a short video detailing their experience â€“ please watch below. 


<div class="video-testimonial-gallery">

{% for testimonial in site.data.testimonials %}
	<a href="{{ testimonial.video }}" 
	    class="mfp-iframe" 
	    title="{{ testimonial.description }}"
        {% if forloop.index > site.data.uiconfig.testimonials_to_show %}
            style="display:none;"
        {% endif %}
	    >
	        <img 
	            src="images/videothumbnails/{{ testimonial.thumbnail }}">
	</a>
{% endfor %}
</div>
